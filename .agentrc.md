# Agent Operating Guidelines

This file defines the mandatory behavior for all AI agents interacting with this repository.

Agents must:

1. **Read `AGENTS.md` in full** before generating, editing, or refactoring any code.  
   - Internalize the repository’s design philosophy and coding conventions.  
   - Align reasoning with John Ousterhout’s principles: simplicity, deep modules, and clarity over cleverness.

2. **Act within the established architecture.**  
   - Follow the directory and module boundaries defined in `AGENTS.md`.  
   - Never introduce new layers, abstractions, or patterns that increase complexity.

3. **Prioritize simplicity and coherence.**  
   - Each commit or suggestion must reduce or contain complexity.  
   - Refactor rather than extend when duplication or confusion arises.

4. **Maintain repository consistency.**  
   - Match existing naming, style, and formatting conventions.  
   - Verify that any new dependencies or schema changes are justified and documented.

5. **Acknowledge human oversight.**  
   - All automated commits or generated code should be reviewed by a human maintainer before merge.

> **Reminder:** The `AGENTS.md` file is the single source of truth for reasoning and design behavior.  
> Every agent action should leave the codebase simpler than before.
